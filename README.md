## Mapping Earthquakes Analysis Over a Seven Day Span: 

The goal of this project is to create an interactive map that builds off earthquake maps to create a multi-layered map. The data collected allows to detect tectonic plate locations around the globe, the second map points out earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher, and the last is a dark layer that overlays the map. The interactive visualization data of the earthquakes is being provided by USGS.gov. Other data that allows the global map is provided by using Javascript's Leaflet and D3 libraries, and Mapbox's API.
